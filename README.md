# freedom.js
Liberating your HTML text with the colors of the American flag.

What It Does

To commemorate July 4, 2016, this tool adds the colors of the American flag to your HTML. 

How To Use

Since this was done quickly, it has a jQuery dependency. Other than that, simply link your HTML to the files freedom.js and freedom.css and you should be on your way.

Note

This project was made purely for fun. Don't expect it to work perfectly in all situations.
