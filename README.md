# freedom.js
Liberating your HTML text with the colors of the American flag.

<b>What It Does</b>

To commemorate July 4, 2016, this tool adds the colors of the American flag to your HTML. 

<b>How To Use</b>

Since this was done quickly, it has a jQuery dependency. Other than that, simply link your HTML to the files freedom.js and freedom.css and you should be on your way.

<b>Note</b>

This project was made purely for fun. Don't expect it to work perfectly in all situations.
